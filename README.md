# Firebase Authentication with Node.js and React
- This project demonstrates how to build a user authentication system using Firebase, Node.js, and React. Users can register and login to the app, and view a list of registered users with details.


# Prerequisites
## Before you can start the frontend and backend, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:
- Node.js 
- React
- MongoDb
- Express

## Getting Started
 
 To get started with the project, follow these steps:
 
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
```yaml
git clone https://github.com/saiprasad8955/StackLabs_Assignment.git
```


2. Install the dependencies for the backend.
```yaml
cd server
npm install
```

3. Start the backend server.
```yaml
cd server
cd src
nodemon index.js
```
This will start the server on http://localhost:5000.


4. Install the dependencies for the frontend.
```yaml
cd client
npm install
```


5. Start the frontend server.
```yaml
npm start
```
This will start the frontend on http://localhost:3000 and open a browser window.



# Usage
## Register a User

Once the frontend and backend servers are running, you can use the application.

1. Navigate to the registration page: http://localhost:3000/signup
2. Enter your email and password and click "Register"
3. You will be redirected to the login page

## Login

1. Navigate to the login page: http://localhost:3000/login
2. Enter your email and password and click "Login"
3. You will be redirected to the home page


## View Users

1. When you logged in and redirected to home page
2. You will able to see a Fetch Users List Button
3. If you click on that button you will see the users that are registered.


## View Users Profile
Despite my attempts, I am unable to implement the functionality to display user details in a pop-up window.
